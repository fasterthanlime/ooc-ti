Intro
=====

Here's a small demo for using ooc applications on a TI89/92+/v200.

It relies on tigcc as you can see from the Makefile.

Also, it uses a modified ooc sdk, in ti-sdk/ with only ooclib.ooc and Object.ooc

Because we use tigcc, we can't use any C99 types, nor the Boehm GC. Still, we can compile very well =)

What you need
=============

  - the latest ooc (from git) http://github.com/amoswenger/ooc
  - tigcc (a recent enough version)
  - A TI 89/92+/v200 graphic calculator or an emulator (e.g. I used tiemu) to test it

The big UChar* array in the source code was generated from manually modifying
the result of the iStudio program. More explanations over at http://tigcc.ticalc.org/tut/pictures.txt

When you run make, if everything is successful, it should've produced "showimg.89z" and "showimg.9xz".
Send one of those file to your calculator depending if you've got a TI89 or a TI-92/v200.
